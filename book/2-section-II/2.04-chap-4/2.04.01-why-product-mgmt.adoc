==== Why Product Management?

Before work, before operations, there must be a vision of product. You already established a preliminary vision in Chapter 1, but now as your organization grows, you need to consider further how you will sustain that vision and establish an ongoing flow of work to realize it.

Like many other topics in this book, product management is a significant field in and of itself. Historically, product management has not been a major theme in enterprise IT management. "Third party" vendors (e.g. IBM) providing the back office systems had product management approaches, but these were external to the IT operations.

IT systems served narrow purposes, often “back office” functions such as accounting or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning[materials planning]. Mostly, such systems were managed as projects assembled on a temporary basis, resulting in the creation of a system to be “thrown over the wall” to operations.

Product management, on the other hand, is concerned with the entire lifecycle. The product manager cares about the vision, its execution, the market reaction to the vision (even if an internal market), the health, care and feeding of the product, and the product’s eventual sunset or replacement.

Reacting to market feedback and adapting product direction is an essential role of the product owner. In the older model, feedback was often unwelcome, as the project manager typically was committed to the open-loop dead reckoning (see http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_special_section_systems_thinking_and_feedback[previous discussion]) of the project plan and changing scope or direction was seen as a failure, more often than not.

Now, it’s accepted that systems evolve, perhaps in unexpected directions. Rapidly testing, learning, failing fast, and pivoting direction are all part of the lexicon, at least for market-facing IT-based products. And even back-office IT systems with better understood scope are being managed more as systems (or products) with lifecycles, as opposed to transient projects. (See the Amazon discussion, below.)

So, what is product management and what does it mean for your team?

===== Defining Product Management

In order to define product management, we first need to define product. In Chapter 1, we established that products are goods, services, or some combination, with some feature that provides value for some consumer. BusinessDictionary.com http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product.html[defines it thus]:

[quote, BusinessDictionary.com]
[A Product is] A good, idea, method, information, object or service created as a result of a process and serves a need or satisfies a want. It has a combination of tangible and intangible attributes (benefits, features, functions, uses) that a seller offers a buyer for purchase. For example a seller of a toothbrush not only offers the physical product but also the idea that the consumer will be improving the health of their teeth…A good or service that most closely meets the requirements of a particular market and yields enough profit to justify its continued existence. As long as cars are manufactured, companies such as Michelin that produce tires fill the market need and continue to be profitable.

Product _management_, according to the http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-management.html#ixzz3bHCVkoWj[same source], is

[quote, BusinessDictionary.com]
[Product Management is] The organizational structure within a business that manages the development, marketing and sale of a product or set of products throughout the product life cycle. It encompasses the broad set of activities required to get the product to market and to support it thereafter.

Product management in the general sense often reports to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). It represents the fundamental strategy of the firm, in terms of its value proposition and viability. The product needs to reflect the enterprise’s strategy for creating and maintaining customers.

Product strategy for internally-facing products may not be defined by the enterprise CMO. If it is a back-office product, then “business within a business” thinking may be appropriate. (Even the payroll system run by IT for HR is a “product,” in this view.) In such cases, there still is a need for someone to function as an "internal CMO" to the external "customers."

As a field, there are professional associations, handbooks, courses of study, and so forth, completely independent of information technology.

However, http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology[as stated in chapter 1], all kinds of industrial products have increasing amounts of “IT” in them. This means that an understanding of IT, and ready access to any needed IT specialty skills, is increasingly important to the general field of product management.

Perhaps the most important aspect of product design is focusing on the user, and what she or he needs. This is easier said than done. Entire books have been written on the various tools and techniques for doing this, from  focus groups to ethnographic analysis.

Product management includes research and development, which means that there is an element of uncertainty. This is of course also true of IT systems development. Often, IT professionals resist drawing lessons from manufacturing, because of a perception (only partially true) that manufacturing is “deterministic” while IT systems development is too “uncertain.”

In reality, manufacturing is less deterministic than IT professionals often perceive, while software development is, at its most uncertain, just another form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development[new product development], and/or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development[research and development] and therefore can be managed on that basis.

See The Phoenix Project, Chapter 30, for an interesting discussion of these issues in an IT context <<Kim2013>>.

We will dive more into the characteristics of R&D processes in the discussion of Don Reinertsen in this chapter.

===== Process, project, and product management
[quote, Mark Kennaley, SDLC 3.0]
A holistic product-oriented approach contradicts a convenient over-simplification of IT delivery where everything is treated as a project. Such an approach is not Lean, in that treating all demand (coarse/strategic demand the same as fine-grained IT demand) amounts to batching, which creates inventory, waiting and potentially over-processing types of waste.

In the remainder of this book, we will continually encounter three major topics:

* Product Management (Chapter 4)
* Project Management (Chapter 8)
* Process Management (Chapter 9)

Each has a dedicated chapter, and they will appear in all the other chapters as well.

Here are some of the key differences between process, project and product management in the context of IT services and systems:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|====
|Process|Project|Product
|Repeatable with a high degree of certainty |Executable with a medium-high degree of certainty |Product management includes research and development which is less certain of outcome
|Fixed time duration, relatively brief (weeks/months)|Limited time duration, often scoped to a year or less
|No specific time duration; lasts as long as there is a need
|Fixed in form, no changes usually tolerated|Difficult to change scope or direction, unless specifically set up to accommodate
|Must accommodate market feedback and directional change
|Used to deliver service value and operate system |Often concerned with system design and construction, but typically not with operation
|Includes service concept and system design, construction, operations, and retirement
|Process owners concerned with adherence and continuous improvement of process. Otherwise can be narrow in perspective.|Project managers are trained in resource and timeline management, dependencies & scheduling. They are not typically incented to adopt a long-term perspective.
|Product managers need to have project management skills as well as understanding market dynamics, feedback, building long-term organizational capability
|====

The above distinctions are deliberately exaggerated and there are of course exceptions (short projects, processes that take years). However, it is in the friction between these perspectives we see some of the major problems in modern IT management

In our scenario, you are now on a tight-knit, collaborative team. It is preferable that you think in terms of developing and sustaining a product. However, projects still exist, and sometimes you may find yourself on a team that is funded and operated on that basis. We will return to projects in Chapter 8.

===== What is a Product Manager?

A Product Manager is the one person in the whole organization who owns the product Requirements effort. Requirements focuses on the WHAT, which means it isn't Development, which focuses on the HOW. Marketing traditionally talks about the WHAT, but cannot necessarily decide what the WHAT should be. At least not at any useful level of detail. - See more at: http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/where-should-product-management-report#sthash.Vgs8NtWw.dpuf

===== Market facing, supporting, back office
revisit "who pays", plus infrastructure

===== Productization as a strategy at Amazon
Amazon represents two critical responses to the problem of large-scale IT failure (as identified in the outset of the book.) First, the founder Jeff Bezos mandated that all software development should be service-oriented, and assume that the functionality being built might at some point be offered to external customers.

Second, a widely reported practice at Amazon.com is the limitation of product teams to between 5-7 people, the number that can be fed by “two pizzas” (depending on how hungry they are).
There are good reasons for this approach. It has long been recognized in software and IT management that larger teams do not necessarily result in higher productivity. The best known statement of this is Fred Brooks’ rule from The Mythical Man-Month, that “adding people to a late project will make it later.”

The reasons for this have been extensively studied and analyzed (***Madachy), but in general it is due to the increased communication overhead of expanded teams. Product design work (of which software development is one form) is creative and highly dependent on tacit knowledge, interpersonal interactions, organizational culture, and other “soft” factors. Products, especially those with a significant IT component, can  be understood as socio-technical systems, often complex. This means that small changes to their components or interactions can have major effects on their overall behavior and value.

This in turn means that newcomers to a product development organization can have a profound impact on the product. Getting them “up to speed” with the culture, mental models, and tacit assumptions of the existing team can be challenging and is rarely simple. The bigger the team, the bigger the problem.

The net result of these two practices is the creation of multiple nimble services that are decoupled from each other, constructed and supported by teams appropriately sized for optimal high-value interactions.
